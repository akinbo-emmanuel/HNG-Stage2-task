# HNG-Stage2-task-solution
This is the solution to the Stage 2 task for HNG internship 8.0.

The first part of the task was, "write a simple program that prints your name using your language of choice (Python)". 
My solution program requests the user's name as an input, stores it in variable, "your_name", and prints it out.

The second part of the task was, "build a html page that contains an application(resum√®) to join a team. Host the page on Netlify or any platform of your choice. CSS is involved. You can also use any frontend language".
